**Overview:**

Our data looks at overdoses in Washington state based on count per quarter for years 2018 - 2023. It then further breaks these counts into races to see if certain races are being more disproportionately affected by overdoses. To figure out proportionality, it is important to take into account the number of overdoses in relation to race vs the total population of each race. Thus, we are working with three datasets: total overdoses, overdoses according to race, and population according to race.

**Key audience:**

Our key audience is everyone who can access our project. The more people are aware of the rising number of overdoses, the more changes that can be made to prevent future overdoses. Specifically, we aim to inform vulnerable populations, healthcare providers, voters, and policymakers. These are groups (not mutually exclusive) that can take the steps necessary to improve the problem.
